# Reinforcement Learning 
## Implementations of Common AI Algorithms used in RL. 
##### This codebase is an implementation of the algorithms discussed in the ['Reinforcement Learning' course by David Silver.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0)

## What is Reinforcement Learning?
Unlike supervised learning, where each training data point is tagged with a 'correct' answer, reinforcement learning agents dont have a set of training data tagged with labels.

In RL an agent takes a series of **actions** through an environment and gets a series of signals that tells it how well its doing. These signals are called **rewards**, and the goal of any RL agent is to learn a series of actions that maximize the total reward through an environment.
